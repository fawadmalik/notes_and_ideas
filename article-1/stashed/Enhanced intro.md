# **Master Salesforce Data Manipulation with Node.js: Create, Retrieve, and Automate**

Imagine having the power to programmatically set up, manipulate, and retrieve Salesforce data with just a few lines of code. Whether you're a QA engineer looking to create realistic test data, a developer automating data setup for demos, or a tech-savvy business analyst exploring Salesforce's vast API capabilities, this guide is for you.

Salesforce is a cornerstone of customer relationship management, but working with its data manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Enter **Node.js and Salesforce APIs**—a powerful combination that empowers you to interact with Salesforce programmatically. From creating test leads to fetching data for validations, Node.js scripts streamline workflows, reduce manual effort, and enable efficient testing and automation.

In this two-part series, you'll learn how to build a robust, reusable foundation for interacting with Salesforce data. **In Part 1**, we’ll cover:
1. Setting up a Salesforce Developer Edition org for free.
2. Creating a secure connection to Salesforce via a Connected App.
3. Writing Node.js scripts to authenticate, create, and retrieve Salesforce data.

This guide goes beyond theory, giving you a practical, hands-on project that you can complete in just a few hours. By the end of this article, you'll have a fully functional setup to programmatically create leads in Salesforce and retrieve their details, ready to be leveraged in Part 2 for writing comprehensive end-to-end tests.
